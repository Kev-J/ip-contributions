Chisel IP Contributions
=======================

If you are here you are hopefully considering contributing some useful chisel modules to
the community. This is the place to do it.

## Contributions

| Package | Type | Author | Descpription |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| BitonicSorter   | internal |  Steve Burns  | A combinational sort generator for arbitrarily typed Vectors |
| IterativeCordic   | internal |  Harrison Liew  | An iterative Cordic implementation |


### Getting Started

To begin with you should have some working Chisel code. 
Adding it is designed to be as simple as possible.
You will be creating a new package here in the src/main/scala and src/test/scala and 
placing your circuit and it's unit tests in those respective directories.

### The Requirements

- Code Style should reasonably follow the default style guide used by the Chisel3 project. See [the chisel3 scalastyle-config](https://github.com/freechipsproject/chisel3/blob/master/scalastyle-config.xml)
- Unit Tests should be provided that reasonable confidence that a contribution works
- Useful README.md should be added in your package directory with contribution specific info.
- Licensing this code is still a  **WIP**
